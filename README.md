### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught UI/UX Designer passionate about designing digital experiences that leave a positive impact on people, the environment, and society. I am from Egypt and have a background in computers and information technology as I am studying a bachelor's degree now. Besides my study, I am developing my skills and portfolio in UX Design by self-study as I am getting my internships and courses from the most popular e-learning websites such as Coursera, Udemy, and Udacity.
